# Media-Summarization-using-DL-and-NLP

Media platforms are significant forums for the dissemination of information, the holding of debates, and the conduct of conversations on a wide range of issues and events occurring all over the world. The development of programmes that use automated text and video summarising techniques to massive volumes of texts and movies, and news information clips resulting in summaries and succinct presentations that serve the purpose for which they were created. A large number of videos and articles have been reported to be available on media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, among others, which cannot be watched or read in their entirety, requiring some summarization to ensure that the most important contents are selected and framed to effectively communicate information throughout the video. The thesis will discuss the many sets of strategies that can be utilised to improve video summarization from various genres of media outlets that are currently available. A number of techniques are applied, including abstractive, extractive, and compositional video summarising, the DPP model (determinantal point process), Query focused summarization, a memory network approach-dataset assessment metric, and the development of textual summary for videos.
